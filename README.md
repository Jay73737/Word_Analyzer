This is a Reddit bot, with several potential end purposes.  At the moment, I am trying to collect statistics on several different measurements on word, character, punctuation, upvote/downvote ratio, the spread of different subreddits commented on, the comment level replied to, how many posts submitted, etc.  The goal eventually is to use this data to create a basic fingerprint for a user.  Possibility of using this to train some machine learning models in the future.
